This project aims to predict the renting prices in different cities using various features from the dataset, such as property type, room type, bed type, cancellation policy, city, cleaning fee, host profile picture availability, host identity verification, and instant bookability. Our goal is to understand how these features influence renting prices and to build a predictive model to assist renters and landlords alike.
